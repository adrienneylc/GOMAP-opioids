# GOMAP-Opioids

## Introduction
This repository contains the R codes used in the study titled, "International Trends in Opioid Prescribing by Age and Sex from 2001 to 2019: an observational study using population-based databases from 18 countries and one special administrative region". The coordinating centre distributed the common protocol and output templates, the participating site would generate aggregated results locally and only the final aggregated results from each participating site were shared with the study coordinator. R codes included here were used to pool the aggregated results from each sites by meta-analyses, and generate visualisations of the results. These codes are intended to provide transparency and reproducibility of the study results, and can be used as a reference for similar studies in the future. Please refer to the documentation in the repository for further information on the data used, methods employed, and results obtained. This readme file explains the specification of the SAS and R codes.
